What's up! You've found your way to my GitHub portfolio 😎

Here you'll find a bunch of Data Science projects that showcase my wizard skills 🧙

**Rapper Face Classification** 🎤 🤑
- Using Support Vector Machines to classify rappers using images of thier faces.
- Rappers used were Kanye West, Drake, Jay-Z, Eminem, and Nicki Minaj
- Faces extracted from Google Images photos, using the OpenCV Face Cascade classifier
- Fully developed backend, hosted on a Python Flask server, with a user-friendly interface so that you can try it out yourself!

**Tableau Sales Insights Dashboard** 💸 📈
- Used to SQL extract, transform and load data from database of sale transactions, customer accounts, markets, and products for a fictional online store AlitQ.
- Revenue analysis: revenue by market, sales quantity by market, top 5 products and customers, and revenue by year.
- Profit analysis: Profit by market, profit trend, customers table, customer type (E-commerce vs brick and mortar).
- Fully interactable, filter by market, year, quarter, month, customer type, etc.

**COVID-19 OWID Dataset SQL and Tableau Analysis** 😷📈
- Used MySQL to create views from the COVID-19 Dataset supplied by Our World In Data
- Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize the results.
- Fully Vaccinated % by country over time, highest infection rate, total cases by country over time, deaths by continent, global numbers.

**Data Cleaning Exercise - Nashville Housing Market Dataset** 🧼🏡
- Straightforward data cleaning exercise on data from the Nashville housing market.

**ARCGIS Map** 🗺🌀
- Used ARCGIS to generate a map of Hurricane Evacuation Routes and Median Household Income by zipcode in Leon County
- Are our current hurricane evacuation measures underserving low income communities? Decide for yourself on my ARCGIS Webapp.

**Alteryx Exercise** 👨🏽‍💻🏋🏽
- Used Alteryx to clean a dataset of Sales Opportunities

**Musical Genre Classification** 🎧 🎨
- Used Convolutional Neural Networks in Tensorflow to predict musical genres from audio files with multilabel classification
- Created and cleaned a dataset of 9,000+ ethically sourced audio files using the Spotify, Deezer and StreamRip APIs.
- Studied the effects of audio data augmentation, sample length, type of spectogram, and use of delta features as channels embedded in the image on test and validation accuracy.
- Made a cool little video showing off what this model can do on some of my favorite songs.

**School Projects and Assignments** 🍢 📚
